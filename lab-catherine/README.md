##  Lab 10: Doubly Linked List, Binary Search, Stacks, and Queues

### Author:
 Catherine Looper

### Motivation

In this project, I built a Doubly Linked List module containing append, remove, and find methods. I then applied those concepts to construct a stack data structure model using Doubly Linked Lists. This project also includes a binary search module that accepts an array of objects and an item to find as its parameters.

### Build

#### Doubly Linked List Module

The Doubly Linked List module contains a class called DoublyLinkedList that is being exported from the module. This class contains an append method that accepts a node as a parameter and adds it to the end of the doubly linked list. The class also contains a remove method that removes a node from the linked list. Finally, I included a find method that accepts a value and searches for the node containing that value.


#### Stack Module

The stack module contains a class called StackLinkedList that is being exported from the module. This class contains an append method that accepts a node as a parameter and adds it to the end of the doubly linked list. The class also contains a push method that accepts a value and calls the append method to add a new value to the linked list. Finally, the class contains a method called pop that serves to remove a value from the end of the doubly linked list in order to model the LIFO properties of stacks.

#### Binary Search Module

The Binary Search module is a version of a binary search that accepts an array of objects as its first argument, and an integer as its second. A binary search should be conducted with an id and return the object in the array based on that id. If the id does not exist then -1 will be returned.

#### Queue Module

There is a queue module in place that functions with arrays and has not yet been refactored using doubly linked lists.
