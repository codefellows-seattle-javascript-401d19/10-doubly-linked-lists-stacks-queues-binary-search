## Features
This assignment includes a doubly linked list,  queue and binary search. 

## Installation
Clone this repo to your local machine then install the npm dependencies necessary to run this guy. 

## Tests

- Queue should not be able to dequeue more than whats in the queue.
- Queue should have First In, First Out behavior.
- A doubly linked list with a single element, should have a value and no next.
- A doubly linked list insert should properly modify the next property
- A doubly linked list remove should remove the node by reference value 
- A doubly linked list remove should only remove the first and only node 
- A doubly linked list find method should find a certain node based on a value given

## How to use?
Once you install the dependencies you should be able to run `npm run test` to start the tests which starts the server in your CLI.
